#### This is my starter template for prototyping and static projects.

It includes:

- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) | Build System
- [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) | Development Server
- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) | Javascript
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) | CSS
- [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) | HTML


It also handles images and icon-fonts.

And includes an evolved version of my custom CSS starting structure.  Read more about it here:
[https://github.com/seethroughtrees/styles-seed](https://github.com/seethroughtrees/styles-seed)

#### Installation

To install just clone the repo and run ```npm install && bower install```.

Afterwards you have a completely modular Gulp build system heavily inspired by:

[http://viget.com/extend/gulp-browserify-starter-faq](http://viget.com/extend/gulp-browserify-starter-faq)

#### Usage

To run, you can just type:

```gulp serve```

Which will run all watch commands and open Chrome Canary (if installed) with Browsersync.

or you can run:

```gulp```

To run all the tasks without watching or starting the server.
