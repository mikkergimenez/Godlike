#### This is my starter template for prototyping and static projects.

It includes:

- Gulp
  - Build System
- BrowserSync
  - Development Server
- Browserify
  - Javascript
- Sass
  - CSS
- Jade
  - HTML


To install just clone the repo and run ```npm install && bower install```.

Afterwards you have a completely modular Gulp build system heavily inspired by:

[http://viget.com/extend/gulp-browserify-starter-faq](http://viget.com/extend/gulp-browserify-starter-faq)


To run, you can just type:

```gulp serve```

Which will run all watch commands and open Chrome Canary (if installed) with Browsersync.
